Safely migrate WordPress posts and taxonomies with explicit mapping, verification and rollback.

== Description ==

Core Blueprint Content Migrator is a standalone WordPress utility for copying content between registered post types and taxonomies on the current site.

Post migrations support explicit taxonomy and post-meta mapping. Taxonomy migrations support term hierarchy, explicit term-meta mapping and optional relationship remapping for shared post types.

Every migration uses Analyze → Review → Copy → Verify → Roll back or Finalize. Source content remains intact while the migration is being tested.

Core Blueprint Base is optional. When available, the plugin can register with the Core Blueprint suite and record Governance events.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0-rc1 =
* First public release candidate with Post and Taxonomy migration modes.
